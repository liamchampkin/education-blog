            Hi I'm Liam Smith and I am a 
            %a{:href => ""} Drupal 
            and 
            %a{:href => ""} Wordpress
            designer / developer based in Oxford, UK. I enjoy creating accessible minimal designs for the web that adhere to current standards and respond well to different devices and browsers.
          %p
            I graduated with a degree in Creative Computer Technology at the
            %a{:href => ""} University of Portsmouth 
            and I am now currently working as a Web Developer in Oxford.
          %p
            I have a lot of experience in using Drupal as a back end for my designs but I can also build Wordpress, Tumblr sites as well as social media fan pages and banners. But that's not all so please get in touch if you require my help.
          %p
            When I'm not building websites and interfaces I like to wind down by DJ'ing. You can check some of my mixes out on 
            %a{:href => ""} Soundcloud.
